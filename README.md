# supop-pai-cookiecuttter-template

A cookiecutter template that you can use to start your project.

This template is part of a lecture given at [Institut d'Optique](https://www.institutoptique.fr/).
Students are expected to use last good practice coding tools, including cookiecutter. This template will help them get started with everything installed.

See official website (in French) : https://sites.google.com/view/supop-pai

## Features

- NiceGUI basic app
- QT basic app
- Docs website with sphinx
- pre-commit linting
- pyright type checking
- Unit tests with pytest
- Github CI that will run pre-commit, pytest and pyright for each pushed commit
- Issue and Pull Request templates

## How to use

The following indications assume you have `uv` and `git` installed and usable within your terminal.
See [Install instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

1. Create your own repo on github, keep it empty. Optionally, add a License (this template does not have any).
2. Clone it, and note the github web address to your repo (not the git address).
3. Call the following command

    ```bash
    uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/ClementPinard/supop-pai-cookiecuttter-template
    ```

    It will ask for:

    - The project name
    - the repo name: make it so it matches the repo name on github
    - the github web adress of your project

4. copy paste everything in the newly created "cookiecutter_output" folder created in your
previously cloned repo. Note the `/.` after the `cookiecutter_output` folder,
it is essential.

    ```bash
    cp -r cookiecutter_output/. <my cloned repo>
    ```

5. You can now commit and push to have a first version of your project

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "First commit applying template"
    git push
    ```

6. Notice the github actions on your repository.

    Several tests should have been started:

    - Pre-commit linting
    - Pyright type-checking
    - Tests (with pytest and coverage)
    - Documentation building

    They will run each time you push a commit. Use them to make sure your project stay
    at the same quality level throughout development.

    To customize them, you can modify the `.github/workflows/CI.yaml` file in your repo.

7. Start coding !

    - Use the already built-in examples to either construct a Qt app or a NiceGUI app
    - Don't forget to implement tests as you add features.
    - Don't forget to have an up to date README on how to install and use your app.
    - Even better if you are able to construct a good documentation website.
      The pre-built documentation website will look at the docstrings in your code and
      create an index with them. The function in `typed_function` in the `my_module.py`
      file has been extensively typed and documented to show you how it looks like.
